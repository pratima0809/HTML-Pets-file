        <h1>Temperament</h1>
        <p>
            The Pomeranianâ€™s temperament is often described as<br>
            fearless, lively, bold, and feisty. These fluffy little<br>
            dogs are naturally curious and eager to explore and interact<br>
            with their surroundings. Their alert expression, bright eyes,<br>
            and perky ears give them an endearing and inquisitive appearance.<br>
            Although described as spunky, they are very loyal to their human <br>
            companions and are quite affectionate. As with other breeds, early <br>
            socialization and training is essential. As a note, Pomeranians are<br>
            known for barking a lot.
