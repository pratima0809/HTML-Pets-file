        <h1>Origins</h1>
        <p>
             The Pomeranian is considered to be descended <br>
             from the German Spitz. The breed is thought to <br>
             have acquired its name by association with the area<br>
             known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland <br>
             and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of<br>
             the breed, this area is credited with the breeding that led to<br>
             the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was <br>
             lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.<br>
