            The Pomeranian (also known as a Pom, Pommy or Pome)<br>
             is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the<br>
             Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany <br>
             in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small<br>
             size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs,<br>
             specifically the German Spitz.<br>
             Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.<br>
