             Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms<br>
             (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches (20–36 cm) high at the<br>
             withers.[1] They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant <br>
             textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.<br>
             The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well <br>
             known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.<br>
             The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black.<br>
             Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to<br>
             become fashionable by the end of the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian <br>
             comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, <br>
             brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle,<br>
             parti, and blue Merle, plus combinations of those colors.[5] The most common colors are <br>
             orange, black, and cream/white.[
